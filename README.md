#### What I do
I'm the lead consultant and founder of FixedIT.ai where we help companies create cutting edge video analytics for edge devices. We offer developer tools, platforms, advice and consultation to ACAP developers. Our core focus is edge applications for the Axis Communications network cameras. I'm a specialist in Computer Vision, Machine Learning and edge computing with many years of experience of both the deep learning field and the embedded field. I focus on the engineering aspects needed to maximize the bottom line profit for companies.

I share a lot of my knowledge about ACAP development in our e-learning portal (you can sign-up for free): https://learning.fixedit.ai

#### How I do it
* I design and implement advanced algorithms and helps teams deliver more valuable code and better algorithms by knowledge sharing and strategic leadership.
* I use C, C++ and Python and have my expertise in the Linux and embedded Linux environment. I use my experience to build more robust and more efficient code that is easier to read and understand.
* I improve tooling, agility and robustness by applying engineering best practices to MLOps, training code and data management.
* I increase product performance by benchmarking, optimizing implementations and writing extensions for python code.
* I increase accuracy by designing evaluation platforms, profiling code and redesigning algorithms.
* I enable strategic planning by implementing dashboards, tracking KPIs and integrating data lineage, experiment tracking and automating live feed-back loops.

#### What I've done
Before getting into consulting I worked both as a senior developer and as a technical lead at Axis Communications in the video analytics teams. I've got experience from both product development and maintenance as well as software and ML research. I have worked at tiny start-ups with a few developers and at international fortune 500 giants. I have been mentoring new employees, I've been supervisor for master's thesis students, teacher for machine learning classes and have done public speaking and knowledge sharing to teach and inspire people to become the best engineers.
